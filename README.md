# chatgame
A copy of the mtchat repo.  

This repo contains programs to implement a multi-threaded TCP chat server and client

* MtClient.java handles keyboard input from the user.
* ClientListener.java receives responses from the server and displays them
* MtServer.java listens for client connections and creates a ClientHandler for each new client
* ClientHandler.java receives messages from a client and relays it to the other clients.
* Client.java stores information about each connected client including their socket and username
